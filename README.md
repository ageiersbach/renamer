Renames a directory of pdfs. I used this to rename ~ 10,000 files that were in the following formats:
* Date - Filename - Another Filename

Where the date could be formatted : dd.mm.yy, yyyy.mm.d / yyyy.mm.dd etc. 

The desired format was : YYYYMMDD#Filenames, where the filenames were separated by commas. Allowed our database to import the files and load the metadata properly.
